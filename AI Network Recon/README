Network Mapping and Packet Capture Analysis Using Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


		Table of Content
	------------------------
	1. 	Intro
	1.2	The Network Mapper 





This is a draft of what the end result will be if possible, this README is subject to change as NemPac is not yet complete.
I highly advise against NemPac in this state.





1. Intro

	This is meant not as a replacement for IDS/IPS--such as Anomaly based intrusion detection--but rather as an addition to the toolbox. NemPac is made of three parts:
			1.  Packet Capture
			2.  Network Mapping
			3.  AI Comparison

	Using NemPac you can easily monitor for new devices connected to a local network, look for abnormal network traffic and behaviour.
	There are two primary ways someone can get access to your network connected devices:

		1) By performing a physical intrusion, either posing as an employee of the same or another company or just simply by finding an open ethernet port or through the
		wireless network.
		
		2) By performing a digital intrusion, gaining access to devices on the internet through various digital means. This can range from Social Engineering to exploiting
		vulnerabilities on vulnerable devices.

	To help combat these methods NemPac is equipped with both a network mapper, packet capture and analysis and an AI to compare the unknown to the known.


1.2 The Network Mapper

	The Network Mappers job is to scan the network through various means to discover all the hosts it can, it then saves this data to a database. If any new hosts are found
	It will automatically send the new host to the database based on different variables. If it detects a host on IP 10.0.0.5 that has the MAC address of 11:22:33:44:55:66 (host A)
	and this is stored in the database, then after a day it finds that the host on IP 10.0.0.5 now has the MAC address of 22:33:44:55:66:77 (host B) it will attempt to see if 
	Host A has a different IP address, if while host B is checked to see if it is a regular on the network and also checking if the vendor is unusual.
	For example, if NemPac is deployed on the network of a Accountant firm and it is unusual for them to have a Raspberry Pi connected, and host B is shown to be a Raspberry Pi,
	this will then create an alert.

1.3 The Packet Capture and Analysis

	The Packet Capture is simple, its job is only to capture the packets of devices or whole networks, dependent on the situation and the config. Targeted captures are used if
	and alert has been added to a device or if it is specified to do so.
	The Packet Analysis part is the brain of the two. It will analyse packets for unusual traffic, for example packets sent or recieved from a blacklisted IP or port scans,
	perform detailed analysis of packets from devices with alerts, for example take the Raspberry Pi from the Network Mapper example, as a device with an alert it would be
	subject to scans on network behaviour and packet contents.
